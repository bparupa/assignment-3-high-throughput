#Usage:-
Set the File Path: Before running the script, ensure to  have  .ptt file ready. 
Update the script to include the path to ptt file by modifying the file_path variable.
Replace the example path with the actual path where ptt file is located.
Run the Script: Open command line interface (CLI) or terminal. 
Navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Run the script by typing:
Ensure to replace script_name.py with the actual name of your Python script file.
 After running, the script will output a list of gene names that are located within 50 base pairs of each other. This list is indicative of potential operonic structures or functionally related gene clusters and can be used for further genomic analysis or investigation.
Prepare gff File: Ensure gff file is correctly formatted and contains the gene annotations for your organism of interest.
Update the file_path variable in the script to point to gff file. 
Open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved. 
Make sure to replace script_name.py with the actual file name of script.
The script will print a list of genes identified as being within 50 base pairs of each other. This information can be used for further analysis, such as investigating potential operonic structures or functional gene clusters.
